    "### I. Introduction\n",
    "During the week of January 1, 2000, the number one song on the [Billboard Hot 100 chart](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2000-01-01/) was \"Smooth\" by Santana Featuring Rob Thomas. According to Genius lyrics(https://genius.com/2953666), \"'Smooth' is a pinnacle of the tail end of the rock era, and a perfect example of a smooth transition from the classic rock sound (Santana) to modern adult contemporary music (Thomas).' In the lyrics, Santana and Thomas sing to a love interest (presumably a woman).\n",
    ">My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa<br>\n",
    "You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove\n",
    "\n",
    ">I would give my world to lift you up<br>\n",
    "I could change my life to better suit your mood<br>\n",
    "Because you're so smooth\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing \"Smooth\" to [today's (May 19, 2022)](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) number one song on the Billboard Hot 100, [\"First Class\" by Jack Harlow](https://genius.com/Jack-harlow-first-class-lyrics), the lyrics are on the same theme of romance, yet treated in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I been a (G), throw up the (L), s*x in the (A.M.), uh-huh\n",
    "(O-R-O-U-S, yeah) <br>\n",
    "And I can put you in (First class, up in the sky), mm, mm\n",
    "I can put you in (First class)\n",
    "\n",
    "With a little over a 6 decade difference, it is common knowledge that the most popular genre/sound of music will evolve over time with different instruments and technology. In this case, it's Santana's classic rock to Jack Harlow's hip-hop. However, lyrical themes tend to remain, such as love or youth. Given how many and how often songs rise in popularity, as evidenced by the existence of Billboard's Hot 100 chart (since 1958!) that updates weekly, we find that computational methods would be ideal to analyze the large sum of these popular songs that rise in the music market and analyze the changes and nuances in these topics over time. For example, both \"Smooth\" and \"First Class\" are number one hits of their time addressing a love interest, yet the former uses more chivalrous lyrics and the latter more sexual and playful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Research Question\n",
    "#### What lyrical inspirations define the music industry every decade, and how has their treatment changed over time?\n",
    "By analyzing the most popular songs of 1960-2021 according to the Billboard Hot 100 charts and their lyrics, we hope to discover distinct topics in all these songs. We want to know the life cycle of these topics, such as if they endured across decades, fell or rose in popularity, or were only popular for a certain decade. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to answer our research question, we will use topic modeling on the most popular songs from 1960 to 2021 and visualize them using time-series plots and scatterplots. Then, we will verify these topics' distinctiveness to each decade or year in two avenues. First, we'll read samples of the songs assigned to these topics and their metadata (date on chart, weeks on chart, etc.). Second, we will predict year or decade using the matrix containing these topic-modelling distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Hypothesis \n",
    "As hinted in the introduction, we expect to see a topic like love be an enduring theme across all decades, but we believe that the LDA topic modelling will distinguish lyrics about physical attraction and flowery, romantic lyrics (therefore, creating multiple topics about romance). We also expect to see some topics whose top words include niche words specific to a genre that was popular during the time. For example, R&B and rap (particularly, African-American artists) rose in the 1990-2000, meaning that topics with AAVE (African American Vernacular English) could arise as a proxy for those genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Expectations\n",
    "The foundation of our research project is dependent on topic modelling, and if we will be able to find meaningful and distinguishable topics in the song data. Overall, we don't expect to have many different topics given the size of our corpus and span of time it covers. We only expect very common themes to arise as a topic (such as love or youth), but other lyrical topics in music to be lost. For example, many artists are lyrically inspired by politics, but it will be difficult for the topic modelling to pick up a broad topic of \"current events\" because the names of politicians and news events are all very specifc, and the model does not have the domain knowledge to lump them all together."

    "Before carrying our LDA topic modeling on the corpus we created, we will conduct some exploratory data analysis by doing basic SVD to graph the songs in 2-D space in order to look at any immediate outliers and if any visible clusters can be observed. Seeing any clusters could give some intuition for the number of topics to select as a parameter for topic modeling. We will also graph some time-series plots  based on the summary statistics taken from the song metadata to observe general trends about song popularity over time.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA would be appropriate because it allows us to find the degree to which the topical distribution in each document is expected to be sparse. Topical sparsity is advantageous in terms of interpretability which is super important for being about to understand our results. In addition, using LDA to break down the songs by topic would allow us to avoid some of the issues that straight word counts could lead us to due to the amount of lyrics that we are working with, such as overfitting in our models due to the feature space having too many dimensions. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these results, we could try to predict when a certain song was released based on the topic of the song to see if there has been a change in the popularity of certain topics over time. We will also pull songs from each topic and their the most popular words to tune the topics. We will also plot more time-series plots to evaluate the popularity of these topics over time.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To further test these topics in accordance with time period, we will use the doc-topic matrix to cross validate and predict the year of these songs. We will compare \n",
    "\n",
    "doc-topic\n",
    "word-embedding\n",
    "will compare these cross validation scores with \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This would an appropriate method because linear regression would allow us to get a regression line that would be useful for plotting actual vs predicted years with topics as the features.\n",
    "Using word embedding, we could see if the meaning of the most popular words have shifted over time by looking at the words that are most closely related to the words and comparing the similar words between different years. Word embedding is appropriate because it observes the relationships between the tokens in the lyrics, measuiring semantic similarity, giving us distances between pairs of words so that we can use to get word vectors that place simliar words close together in vector space. This way, we can build document vectors that we can use to observe patterns in the corpus of song lyrics. "

    "### II. Corpus Creation"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To answer our research question, we created our own corpus consisting of the Billboard Hot 100 songs for every week in the years 1960-2021, covering a little more than 6 decades of music **(roughly, 62 years * 52 weeks * 100 songs = 322,400 music entries)**. Each week, Billboard.com ranks the \"Hot 100\" songs, stating its peak position on the chart (of all time) and the number of weeks it has been on the chart. We chose to use the Hot 100 charts instead of yearly charts because the Hot 100 charts provide fluctuations in popularity, such as giving statistics for the number of weeks a song has been on a chart. Because Billboard provides archives of this information, we webscraped this data using Beautiful Soup to obtain the most popular songs of the week and then used the song title and artist information to generate links in order to webscrape lyrics from Genius.com. We chose Genius.com because it's the world's greatest collection of song lyrics and uses a mostly-consistent formula for generating its song URLS.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect this data, we wrote the following functions:\n",
    "- `song_data()` given a start and end date, creates a pandas dataframe containing all weekly Billboard Hot 100 Chart song metadata and all the associated song lyrics (text data) from Genius.com\n",
    "- `metadata()` (helper function) webscrapes Billboard Hot 100 Chart data.\n",
    "- `append_lyrics()` (helper function) webscrapes Genius lyrics using information from song metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this was extremely computationally expensive. Generating the song data (metadata + lyrics) for one year only takes roughly 8 minutes, but seeing as we wanted to cover every weekly chart for 62 years, this means the time needed to collect this data is in total **8.2 hours**! To do this within a reasonable amount of time, we split the work among several notebooks, ran them simultaneously, and concatenated them all outside of this notebook. We demo these functions with only two weeks below."

    "####  **A. Limitations**\n",
    "Our functions were not able to pick up on a a decent number of edge cases. Typically, the formula for a Genius.com lyrics URL is `'https://genius.com/'`+`artist name`+`song title`+`'-lyrics'` but songs with ensemble casts, such as in TV shows or musicals, were able to be added to the corpus. Additionally, compared to the 1960s-1980s, many 21st century musicians use interesting punctuation for their stage names, and Genius.com treated the punctuation for these artists inconsistently for their URLS. For example, our function was able to get lyrics for A`$`AP Rocky, but not Ty Dolla `$`ign. Additionally, while 62 years is a long span of time, it captures a very small part of the history of music. Billboard.com only has chart information dating back to 1958. To answer our research question, a longer span of time would be preferred."

Out of last week and this week's Hot 100 songs, we collected the data for 188 out of 200. This is because we could not account for extreme edge cases in our function (such as songs with a large amount of artists and artists with interesting punctuation) and found that for certain Genius.com songs, the links were named inconsistently. Additionally a small subset of songs from 1960-1998 were instrumental songs, which had no lyrics (also accounting for less data)."
