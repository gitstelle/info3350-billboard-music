    "To answer our research question, we created our own dataset consisting of the Billboard Hot 100 songs for every week in the years 2000-2021, covering two decades of music **(roughly, 22 years * 52 weeks * 100 songs = 114,400 music entries)**. Each week, Billboard.com ranks the \"Hot 100\" songs, stating its peak position on the chart (of all time) and the number of weeks it has been on the chart. Because Billboard provides archives of this information, we webscraped this data using Beautiful Soup to obtain the most popular songs of the week and then used the song title and artist information to generate links in order to webscrape lyrics from Genius.com.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect this data, we wrote the following functions:\n",
    "- `song_data()` webscrapes the Billboard Hot 100 charts to get song metadata and the lyrics of those songs, stores it all in a pandas dataframe\n",
    "- `append_lyrics()` (helper function) webscrapes Genius lyrics using information from song metadata.\n",
    "- `valid_dates()` from a list of dates, keeps only those that have a real Billboard chart\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this was extremely computationally expensive. Generating the song data (metadata + lyrics) for one week only takes 1.5 minutes, but seeing as we wanted to cover every weekly chart for 22 years, this means the time needed to collect this data is in total **28.6 hours**! To do this within a reasonable amount of time, we split the work among 21 notebooks, ran them simultaneously, and concatenated them all in this notebook (the file is too big to push to Github). We demo these functions with only one week below."
